      <description>What? A December of Algorithms 2019 was an open coding challenge organized by SVCE-ACM student chapter. For each day of the month they presented a small algorithmic programming problem. Solutions to all of the problems had to be submitted by 2020-01-10.
Why? The holidays were approaching and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d need something to keep my little grey programming brain cells active. I was aware of Advent of Code, but I decided to do this challenge instead, because I considered it to be more approachable and doable, for sure.</description>
