<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>At some point this summer I noticed that I spend too much time browsing
through listings on <a href="http://muusikoiden.net/tori">Muusikoiden.net&rsquo;s tori</a> (a
Finnish marketplace for used music gear). Of course, as a programmer the
first thing that comes to mind is automate things, so I did. The goal was to
develop a program that scrapes new listings from the site and sends a daily
summary of them via email.</p>
<h3 id="development-process">Development process</h3>
<p>I started by looking at what web scraping libraries were available for
Haskell. I took a look at <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful
Soup</a> just in case it would
blow me away by elegant API-design and be an excuse to get more into Python.
Beautiful Soup&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">documentation</a> is
huge and it discouraged me somewhat. Surely it does a lot more than the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scalpel">scalpel</a> package that I
ultimately chose, but for a project with a very limited scope the latter
seemed more appealing. With hindsight, a Python project would have been
easier to deploy.</p>
<p>Scalpel&rsquo;s API is very declarative, so sometimes it was very hard to follow
why it scraped the things it did. I had to stare at the package&rsquo;s
documentation&rsquo;s examples for a couple of hours before I got a hang of
it. Muusikoiden.net&rsquo;s HTML structure is from early 2000s so the layout is
heavily based on HTML tables and that surely didn&rsquo;t help either. Still, I&rsquo;m
pleased at how the web scraping code turned out modular, easily composable
and pretty succinct.</p>
<p>With web scraping part out of the way, I implemented logic for filtering
already seen listings and how to render the scraped data back to HTML. I used
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html">blaze-html</a> for the latter
and it was easy to use and integrated nicely. Out of curiosity I also tried
out <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clay">Clay</a>, which is a CSS
preprocessor implemented as an EDSL in Haskell. It&rsquo;s type-safe way of writing
CSS was nice, but compiling every time to see the differences wasn&rsquo;t very
developer friendly. Maybe Clay&rsquo;s advantages come forth better in larger
projects than mine. I didn&rsquo;t put too much effort in making the layout
beautiful. I&rsquo;m all about functionality when making things for myself ðŸ˜‡.</p>
<p>Sending email was as easy as it should be. Most of it was just defining the
configuration. For configuration, I used <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
which is described as a programmable configuration language, though I didn&rsquo;t
really exploit the programmable features. I used it because it integrates
really well with Haskell. I didn&rsquo;t have to hand-roll any logic for dealing
with configuration files. Instead, I had to just describe the configuration
file&rsquo;s structure and data types.</p>
<p>The program was coming together and I began thinking about deploying it.
Initially I thought that the program would run on my Raspberry Pi and it
would be invoked daily with a cronjob. But it turned out that the Haskell
compiler support for ARM architectures was very limited and getting Stack
(the Haskell build tool I use) to work on it was beyond me. This is the only
point in the development process that I regretted choosing Haskell.</p>
<p>It was clear that I couldn&rsquo;t host the program myself, so I started
investigating how to utilize Google Cloud&rsquo;s infrastructure to make it work. I
ended up refactoring the program to be a web app so that it could be deployed
in a Docker container and then invoked periodically with Cloud Scheduler&rsquo;s
request. Cloud Run is server-less, so I couldn&rsquo;t depend on just dumping the
listing numbers in a file, so I had to use a database for persistence. I
chose Redis because it has a really simple API. The silver lining of all this
is that now the program didn&rsquo;t depend on my hardware so up-time will probably
be better. <small>(Raspberry Pis aren&rsquo;t known for their reliability)</small>.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>It took a while to develop this project and the process wasn&rsquo;t without
setbacks, but I&rsquo;m pretty confident that the time investment will pay out
eventually. Nowadays I don&rsquo;t really browse Muusikoiden.net anymore. I just
wait for the summary to arrive in my inbox. I feel like while coding this
project in Haskell strengthened my grasp on using monads and ability to
figure out libraries.</p>
