<h3 id="what">What?</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/atarv/A-December-of-Algorithms-2019">A December of Algorithms
2019</a> was an open
coding challenge organized by SVCE-ACM student chapter. For each day of the
month they presented a small algorithmic programming problem. Solutions to
all of the problems had to be submitted by 2020-01-10.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>The holidays were approaching and I thought I&rsquo;d need something to keep my
little gray programming brain cells active. I was aware of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019">Advent of
Code</a>, but I decided to do this challenge
instead, because I considered it to be more approachable and doable, for
sure. The algorithms that were chosen for the problems turned out to be
fairly well-known and traditional, which, from a perspective of a student,
was nice.</p>
<p>Some of the problems I had encountered whilst doing courses about data
structures and algorithms, e.g. traveling salesman. Recursion and dynamic
programming were already familiar to me. I can imagine that some of the
challenges could have been challenging for a first year student who&rsquo;d
probably have done only the introductory programming and algorithms courses.</p>
<h3 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell?</h3>
<p>A couple of my friends were doing our university&rsquo;s
<a href="https://functional-programming.it.jyu.fi/master/pages/Tasks.md">course</a>
about functional programming and bemoaning how hard it is to write Haskell.
That prompted me to brush up my Haskell skills and show that it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em>
hard. I had done the course last year, so I had acquired the skills
sufficient enough to overcome the challenge. Though, I admit that it
certainly wasn&rsquo;t the easiest way to do the challenge. It surely didn&rsquo;t help
that there were very few examples of how to solve i.e. graph problems in
Haskell. Also, I tried to keep the dependencies to the minimum.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>
describes Haskell with following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language
with type inference and lazy evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What each of those fancy features means is best explained on the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell
homepage</a>. <small>(Scroll down a bit to see the
explanations with examples)</small></p>
<p>While working on the problems, I was regularly amazed by how expressive
Haskell code can be. I think some of the best examples are
<a href="https://github.com/atarv/A-December-of-Algorithms-2019/blob/master/December-06/haskell_atarv.hs">06</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/atarv/A-December-of-Algorithms-2019/blob/master/December-27/haskell_atarv.hs">27</a>.
Ignoring comments and type annotations (which are optional, but
I happen to prefer typing them out) the code is, is in my opinion, really
concise. Of course there were problems (like
<a href="https://github.com/atarv/A-December-of-Algorithms-2019/blob/master/December-08/haskell_atarv.hs">08</a>)
that would have been easier to solve in other languages like C++ or Python.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all I&rsquo;m happy that the coding challenge didn&rsquo;t take too big of a
slice of my holidays and I got time to spend time with family and relax
petting our cat. I think that I got better at approaching problems from a
functional programming perspective and certainly learned a lot about Haskell
while revising the stuff that was taught on our university&rsquo;s FP course. I
read quite a lot of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good</a> and I think it is a good tutorial. The
humour in the book is witty (although sometimes mean) and I really like the
doodles illustrating the book.</p>
