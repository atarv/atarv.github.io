<p>I built this <a href="http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric">OSRIC</a>‚Ñ¢ compatible
random character generator, not because there isn&rsquo;t
<a href="https://osricrpg.com/tools/index.php">one</a> or
<a href="https://osricrpg.com/wizardawn/tool_oadvg.php">another</a> already, but because
none of them is my own üòÅ. It is a bit limited right now, because it only
generates characters&rsquo; attributes, alignments, class-race combinations and
randomized levels. Maybe I will extend it by making generation of names,
items, small descriptions and such possible in the future.</p>
<p>I wrote the back-end in Haskell and front-end in Elm, which both are functional
programming languages. The back-end relies heavily on SQLite as I decided to
codify game rules as such so that they could also be used easily from other
programming languages (maybe I&rsquo;ll build more OSRIC related software).
That didn&rsquo;t turn out to be a bit problematical as SQL (or at least especially
SQLite) has a bit peculiar behavior with generating random numbers in
queries. So I had to write, for example, class and race restrictions in
Haskell, which wasn&rsquo;t too bad, because I got to &ldquo;reuse&rdquo; the code in the
front-end.</p>
<p>This project also made me venture into serverless computing (as it&rsquo;s hosted
on Google Cloud Run) and Docker. I had some problems with getting the Docker
builds to behave nicely. First I had the SQLite database as a data file,
which Haskell stack places amongst the build files and the binary, of course,
would use that weird path only. I had to change the program to take the
database path as a command line argument, which wasn&rsquo;t much of a hassle.
Now it seems to work a-ok and the hosting won&rsquo;t cost much at all.</p>
